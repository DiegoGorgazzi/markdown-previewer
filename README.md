This is a challenge project from freeCodeCamp (FCC) which consists in building an App from scratch. The App is a Build a Markdown Previewer.

I've included the original text below with instructions on what they want students to accomplish (copied from: https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer/).

### What I did
* Solved the problem using React following the specs from FCC.

### What I'm probably going to be doing after this
* Although not required or necessary (because there's no data stored in the server from the user), I'd be nice to add a "sanitize" function.

##  Contributing
The main purpose of this repository was to solve the challenge and share my solution.

This, to me, was a pretty boring project. I'm not expecting contributions at all (I'm not even sure there's anything cool or productive to do with this previewer), but if you know me, I hardly say "no" to anything so, if you want to contribute, be my guest. Also, as always, if you have comments on the code I wrote I'd love to hear from you as well. I'll take all criticism as constructive (but try to be nice!).  

### Code of Conduct
Please keep it professionally clean and friendly. That includes, but is not limited to:
* Being patient. If you get frustrated, step away from the keyboard for a few minutes or hours before you do something you might regret later (if you need a few days, maybe you're in the wrong business?).
* Being all inclusive. We are all people of different age, sex, religion, race, nationality, etc, etc. But, we're all people. Treat people like people and that'll be a good start.

### Time is always in short supply
* Time is always precious. There's always another project in the pipeline that needs (or would be nice) to be done and applying improvements to past projects is always a challenge. Still, I'll do my best to come back to this if there are any improvements (obviously, there's always room for styling improvements...). If you contribute and I don't reply right away please accept my apologies in advance but know your contribution is important and I will reply as soon as possible.

# Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Markdown Previewer
Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/GrZVVO.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning frontend frameworks. Additional technologies not listed above are not recommended and using them is at your own risk. We are looking at supporting other frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue, but they are not currently supported. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

User Story #1: I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

User Story #2: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

User Story #3: When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

User Story #4: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

User Story #5: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

User Story #6: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.
Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): When I click a link rendered by my markdown previewer, the link is opened up in a new tab (HINT: read the Marked.js docs for this one!).

Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.

You can build your project by forking this CodePen pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js

Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.

Remember to use the Read-Search-Ask method if you get stuck.
